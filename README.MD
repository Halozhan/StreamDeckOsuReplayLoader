# What is this?
This is a plugin for Elgato stream deck that can save and load osu! replay file easily.
only perform one action.

# Why should I use this?
By default in osu!, Relax or Autopilot, etc. mods are not saved in the replay file automatically.  
So if you want to save and load them, press F2 in the results screen and open Explorer then import the replay file manually.  
But this thing is very annoying. So I made this plugin.

# How to use?
Download the plugin at [release page](https://github.com/Halozhan/StreamDeckOsuReplayLoader/releases)
just install it and set the path of osu! replays directory in the stream deck settings.

Then you can just press the button when you see the results screen.
